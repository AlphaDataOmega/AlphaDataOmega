# 🧬 AlphaDataOmega: Founder’s Handbook

Welcome to the origin. This is the source repo for the **AlphaDataOmega** ecosystem — a decentralized, creator-first network driven by real attention, algorithmic fairness, and radical transparency.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

AlphaDataOmega is a decentralized social protocol and economic system built to reward truth, creativity, and presence. It combines:

- ⚡️ A **view-based engagement economy** (TRN rewards per verified view)
- 🛡️ **User-controlled moderation** with on-chain flags and AI escalation
- 🧠 **DAO-backed governance** with revenue splits to Investor NFTs and Country NFTs
- 🪙 A dual-token system: **TRN (earn/spend)** + **BRN (mint/burn)**

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started (For Devs)

1. Clone this repo
2. Read the full [ado-dev-docs](https://alphas-personal-organization.gitbook.io/ado-dev-docs) technical breakdown
3. Install dependencies in each package:

   ```bash
   cd ado-core && npm install
   cd ../thisrightnow && npm install
   ```

4. Run tests and lint checks:
   - From `ado-core/` run `npx hardhat test`
   - Use `npx ts-node test/RetrnScoreEngine.test.ts` (or the provided npm script) for the standalone engine test
   - From `thisrightnow/` run `npm run lint`

5. Suggested first steps:
   - Review `contracts/ViewIndex.sol`
   - Build out basic post/feed UI in `frontend/`
   - Test Merkle drop logic from `indexer/` hooks

## 🔐 Contribution Zones

| Zone | Who Can Build Here | Notes |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| 🖼️ Frontend UI | Any contributor | Built in React, Tailwind, TRN hooks |
| 📜 Smart Contracts | Core team only | Critical logic: UsageOracle, AMMs, Moderation |
| 🧾 Indexers | Advanced devs | Must sync with on-chain events and Merkle proofs |
| 🧪 AI Modules | Experimental | Embedding search, Trust Oracles, auto-flag escalation |

## 💰 Governance & Revenue Structure

- 💸 10% of all platform earnings flow to the DAO.
- 🧑‍💼 33% of the DAO’s earnings are split across 100 Investor NFTs.
- 🌍 Country NFTs earn per-jurisdiction based on view counts.
- 🫂 Creators earn TRN directly from view activity + retrns + resonance.
