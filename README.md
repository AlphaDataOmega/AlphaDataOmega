# 🧬 AlphaDataOmega: Founder’s Handbook

Welcome to the origin. This is the source repo for the **AlphaDataOmega** ecosystem — a decentralized, creator-first network driven by real attention, algorithmic fairness, and radical transparency.

## 📚 Project Overview

AlphaDataOmega is a decentralized social protocol and economic system built to reward truth, creativity, and presence. It combines:

- ⚡️ A **view-based engagement economy** (TRN rewards per verified view)
- 🛡️ **User-controlled moderation** with on-chain flags and AI escalation
- 🧠 **DAO-backed governance** with revenue splits to Investor NFTs and Country NFTs
- 🪙 A dual-token system: **TRN (earn/spend)** + **BRN (mint/burn)**
