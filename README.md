# üß¨ AlphaDataOmega: Founder‚Äôs Handbook

Welcome to the origin. This is the source repo for the **AlphaDataOmega** ecosystem ‚Äî a decentralized, creator-first network driven by real attention, algorithmic fairness, and radical transparency.

---

## üìö Project Overview

AlphaDataOmega is a decentralized social protocol and economic system built to reward truth, creativity, and presence. It combines:

- ‚ö°Ô∏è A **view-based engagement economy** (TRN rewards per verified view)
- üõ°Ô∏è **User-controlled moderation** with on-chain flags and AI escalation
- üß† **DAO-backed governance** with revenue splits to Investor NFTs and Country NFTs
- ü™ô A dual-token system: **TRN (earn/spend)** + **BRN (mint/burn)**

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started (For Devs)

1. Clone this repo
2. Read the full [ado-dev-docs](https://alphas-personal-organization.gitbook.io/ado-dev-docs) technical breakdown
3. Install dependencies in each package:

   ```bash
   cd ado-core && npm install
   cd ../thisrightnow && npm install
   ```

4. Run tests and lint checks:
   - From `ado-core/` run `npx hardhat test`
   - Use `npx ts-node test/RetrnScoreEngine.test.ts` (or the provided npm script) for the standalone engine test
   - From `thisrightnow/` run `npm run lint`

5. Suggested first steps:
   - Review `contracts/ViewIndex.sol`
   - Build out basic post/feed UI in `frontend/`
   - Test Merkle drop logic from `indexer/` hooks
