# Current Project Progress - July 2025

This document captures the most up-to-date progress across the AlphaDataOmega monorepo. It complements the Founder's Handbook and project roadmap in `README.md`.

## Completed Milestones

- **Monorepo foundation** – Directory structure established with packages for `ado-core`, `thisrightnow`, `ado-dashboard`, `indexer`, and shared utilities. Contracts compile under Hardhat.
- **Identity recovery flow** – Pages like `recover.tsx` and `recovery-status.tsx` showcase a shard-based recovery UI. Supporting utilities and `RecoveryOracle.sol` contract stubbed with initial tests.
- **Governance features** – Early dashboard pages implement vote participation tracking and governance analytics. ProposalFactory lifecycle tests verify creation and execution of proposals.
- **Indexer utilities** – Scripts under `indexer/` aggregate view data, earnings, lotto picks, and vault activity. Adapters and aggregator functions outline Merkle build steps.
- **Settings UI** – Basic settings page integrates `wagmi` wallet hooks and toggles for preferences. Demonstrates initial front-end wiring.
- **Core contract stubs** – Modules such as `TRNUsageOracle`, `ViewIndex`, `PostVaultSplitter`, and `FlagEscalator` exist with placeholders for full logic. Unit tests cover early modules.
- **Documentation** – `CORE_ASSUMPTIONS.md` enumerates critical design rules (TRN flow enforcement, vault routing, trust weighting, non-transferable BRN). `README.md` describes architecture and usage.

## Outstanding Roadmap Items

According to the roadmap in `README.md`:

- **Phase 1** tasks still pending include full stubs for major contracts, basic frontend MVP actions, view indexer JSON logs, and testnet deployment.
- **Phase 2** requires Bless/Burn and Boosting modules, Merkle drop simulations, and VaultSplitter payout logic.
- **Phase 3** will focus on DAO governance: CouncilNFT proposals, MasterNFT veto flow, and on-chain voting UI.

## Recent Development Highlights

- Added utilities like `aggregatePostEarnings.ts` and `vault earnings` adapters in the indexer package.
- Implemented `UserSettingsManager.sol` with tests, enabling per-account configuration storage.
- Created recovery approval components and admin dashboards to monitor shard approvals.
- Implemented vote tracking and a governance leaderboard, surfacing participation metrics through API routes and pages.
- Scaffolding for RecoveryOracle and manual vault restoration logic added in contracts and scripts.

## Test and Lint Status

Automated tests exist under `test/` but require `ts-node` and package installs. Test runs were attempted in this environment but failed due to missing dependencies, so results are pending.

## Next Steps

1. Flesh out the TRNUsageOracle and vault contracts with real logic.
2. Expand frontend components for posting, boosting, and view tracking.
3. Complete indexer processes for generating Merkle proofs of earnings.
4. Deploy the system to a testnet and verify end-to-end flows.
